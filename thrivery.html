        <h3>Market Research</h3>
        <p>Data-driven decision making is at the heart of our social media strategy.  Through comprehensive market research, including a SWOT analysis and competitor analysis, we identified valuable trends.  Competitors relied heavily on sterile visuals and static Reels, but we saw the power of vibrant backgrounds and human connection in successful campaigns.  Additionally, high-performing posts often featured collaborations or new product reveals.  By translating these learnings into action, we crafted a social media strategy focused on captivating visuals, engaging Reels with a human touch, strategic partnerships to broaden reach, and targeted hashtags for optimal discoverability. This approach positions our brand for a thriving social media presence.</p>

            <h3>Photoshoot & Social Media Recommendations</h3>
            <p><strong>Photoshoot</strong><br>One of the main things we wanted to achieve for the Thrivery this semester in terms of the creative side, was give them a new bank of photos to use for their social media posts and flyers. 
                We spoke with them about what look they wanted to go for and we decided to create ingredient based photos of their juices with white backgrounds to keep it as clean as possible. 
                We were able to go to The Thrivery and shoot their juices with the new labels they got since they changed their name, and came out with some great photos theyâ€™ll be able to use.
